# Round 3 — growth remediation design (2026-08-30)

Design round for the two unbounded-growth criticals (F1/F1c owned registries,
F2 funcMeta opaque retention) plus a complete growth inventory. Design work by
three independent expert passes; rulings are evidence-backed. Implementation
follows the specs below.

## Ruling 1 — the sticky registration gate is dead

Skipping `registerOwnedValue`/`registerOwnedChannel` until the first
cancel/detach (bounding never-canceled interpreters) was tested empirically
against a scratch clone: 16 of the PR's own tests fail, including
`TestGorneshDetachedRootIsolatesCanceledDeferredAggregateWrites` (zombie
deferred writes reach the new root: "old deferred write reached new graph")
and the host-shared publication tests. Pre-cancel allocations are exactly the
ones the first detach must clone; unregistered ⇒ `cloneMap/clonePointer/
cloneSlice` return the original (owned.go ~2958-3013) ⇒ shared with the
zombie, and `hostSharedEstimate` stays 0 so host-identity preservation breaks.
No arming point can fix this. Registration must remain universal; bounding
must come from eviction.

## Ruling 2 — the pruning collector's invariant

`collectReachableObjectsLocked` (owned.go ~2455-2459) does NOT descend into
unregistered Map/Ptr/Slice containers (`objects := ownedObjectsForValueLocked;
if len == 0 return`). This is safe only under the inductive invariant
"unregistered ⇒ unreachable from every cell a live or future execution can
touch", preserved because sweeps evict containers together with everything
reachable only through them, and because new sweeps must use a root set that
is a SUPERSET of the existing ones (Eval-end sweep + frame-exit release).

## F1/F1c remediation — bounded incremental ownership sweep ("ownedGC")

IMPLEMENTED 2026-08-30 (interp/owned.go armOwnedGCLocked/maybeRunOwnedGCSweep/
ownedGCSweepLocked, interp/run.go execWithFuncSweepFence + runCfg registration,
interp/program.go prepareExecutionFrame secondary trigger; tests in
interp/gornesh_owned_gc_internal_test.go). Deviations from the ruling as
written: (1) the eviction predicate follows the actual sweepRootOwnedObjectsLocked
body, which does NOT exempt hostShared objects (the `!hostShared` term in the
paraphrase below does not exist in the code); (2) capture cells are read
directly under funcMu with the exclusive fence instead of via
snapshotFuncMetaCapture, which acquires funcMu.RLock (self-deadlock under the
sweep's funcMu.Lock) and returns a copy that would defeat the interval
collector's interior-pointer keep-alive; (3) the channel "owner not active"
predicate keeps only non-root owners with a live activeFrames entry — root-owned
channels follow the existing sweepRootOwnedChannels semantics (evictable when
unreachable), which is required for boundedness under top-level churn — and
channels referenced by non-terminal send values are pinned explicitly, since a
channel buffered inside another channel is not reflect-traversable; (4) a new
frameDrains counter (incremented under the exclusive fence in the runCfg exit
path) gates the whole sweep: a draining frame's remaining deferred call values
are invisible to the root set, so the sweep stays pending while any drain is
active. All Gornesh tests, including the 63 detached-root isolation tests,
pass under -race; the full interp suite matches its pre-existing GOPATH-layout
failure baseline.

Universal registration preserved; run the same eviction as
`sweepRootOwnedObjects` incrementally against a complete active-frame root set.

State (interp): `activeFrames map[*frame]int` (refcount, funcMu-guarded, root
reentrancy-safe), `ownedGCPending/ownedGCInFlight atomic.Bool`,
`ownedRegistrations int` (funcMu). Constants: cap 1<<16 entries, amortize
1<<12 registrations.

Arming (inside existing funcMu sections only, never taking the fence):
increment `ownedRegistrations` at every registry insert
(registerOwnedValue ~196, registerOwnedChannel ~218, registerNativeResultValuesFromExec
~989, cloner commits ~3303/~3438, adoptOwnedObjectLocked ~1858,
publishOwnedChannelLocked ~438); when registry size ≥ cap and registrations ≥
amortize, set `ownedGCPending`.

Trigger — the load-bearing locking decision: consume at the TOP of
`execWithFuncSweepFence` (run.go ~506) before any acquisition, where the
goroutine holds no locks: if pending && inFlight.CAS, `funcSweepMu.TryLock()`,
sweep, unlock; always reset inFlight (panic-safe defer); TryLock loss ⇒ retry
next step. Secondary trigger: inside `prepareExecutionFrame` after
`interp.mutex.Unlock()` while the fence write is still held. Never upgrade the
fence while holding funcMu (the fence is not reentrant; an inline upgrade from
registerOwnedValue would fatal against write-held callers like
publishHostValueLocked).

Root set (all under funcMu; frame cells via snapshotFrameValues under
f.mutex.RLock after funcMu): (1) durable globals =
snapshotOwnedReachabilityValues(interp.frame); (2) EVERY frame in activeFrames
plus its full anc chain up to its root, ALL cells, regardless of funcState —
this covers parked-in-native and zombie-draining frames (zombie frames stay
registered until after the run.go release sequence); (3) every funcMeta group
capture cell; (4) directFuncs values. Eviction: exactly the
sweepRootOwnedObjects predicate (`!hostShared && channelRefs == 0 && no panic
token && !reachable && !(Ptr && visited.contains)`), via
unregisterOwnedObjectLocked; channels per sweepRootOwnedChannels semantics
(retire terminal sends; owner-not-active predicate). Collector extension: add
`reflect.Chan` to collectReachableObjectsLocked recording channel registry
hits (additive; existing callers pass nil).

Frame registry maintenance: `activeFrames[f]++` in the existing
`funcState = funcFrameActive` window (run.go ~381-383); decrement/delete in a
fresh funcMu window immediately after the release sequence (run.go ~447),
before the repanic. runCfg is the ONLY activation site (5 call sites:
runOnFrame ~293, declared-wrapper invoke ~1633, go-stmt ~2044, interpreted
call ~2047, closure-wrapper invoke ~2686; zombie drain re-enters via the
wrappers).

Semantics: strictly more conservative than the Eval-end sweep (superset root
set) ⇒ never evicts anything the current sweep would keep ⇒ cancel-isolation
preserved with no relaxation. Residuals to document: forever-blocked
goroutines pin one activeFrames entry each (Go-like); workloads whose live set
exceeds the cap pay one O(live+registry) sweep per amortization window.

Test plan: registry bounded under a ~1M-allocation root loop (sample from a
watcher goroutine); same for channel churn; isolation preserved across a
cancel occurring after a long pre-cancel allocation loop; live captures kept
while sweeps run; sweep under a zombie-draining fence (no deadlock).

## F2 remediation — PurgeRetainedFuncs + per-Eval walk inversion

Opaque funcMeta entries are created by four writers (Eval returns, contended
fence preserve-all, channel publish, panic publish) and deleted by none; only
panic-published groups demote back (adoptOwnedPanicGroupLocked ~1836). The
permanent population is Eval-returned funcs and contended-fence preserve-alls.

API: `func (interp *Interpreter) PurgeRetainedFuncs() int` — number of
metadata entries removed; idempotent. Experimental doc comment must state the
contract: values reachable from package-level variables are never purged and
keep re-binding; a purged value remains callable (self-contained MakeFunc
wrapper) but permanently executes against its original root — after a later
cancel/detach its writes land in the abandoned root and lose channel-ownership
tracking. WARNING: do not call from interpreted code, from a host callback of
a running evaluation, or while paused under the debugger. Called from an
unrelated goroutine it blocks until evaluations quiesce.

Mechanics (group-scoped — REQUIRED because callOwnerBinder aliases share
`meta.group` and `lookupInterpretedFunc`'s convertible-type fallback would
resurrect a key-scoped purge):
1. Snapshot under funcMu.RLock: candidates (retention == opaque, any root
   generation), group members (all keys sharing each group), group captures +
   versions; eligibility per group: `pending == 0 && len(panicTokens) == 0 &&
   no non-terminal ownedChannelSend references it`.
2. Anchors (fence held): current root global cells (directFuncs values are deliberately NOT anchors: cloned wrappers get fresh groups and the clone cache holds self-referential entries, which would keep purge non-idempotent; directFuncs entries are instead cleaned by either endpoint matching a deleted key).
   Collect exact canonical func values once; any ambiguous func-capable
   container marks all candidates live. Capture fixpoint via
   snapshotFuncMetaCapture (mirrors sweepRootInterpretedFuncs).
3. Delete under funcMu.Lock: candidate keys of live groups skipped; deleted
   groups delete ALL member keys (aliases); delete directFuncs entries whose
   source key was deleted; rebuild each affected frame's funcMeta slice
   (template: deleteUnreachableRootFuncMeta ~836-841).
4. Then re-run the owned-object sweep via a factored
   `sweepRootOwnedObjectsLocked(root)` (split the fence-acquiring wrapper from
   the body) to free captures pinned only by deleted frames; the exact
   hostSharedEstimate is maintained by unregisterOwnedObjectLocked.

Locking order (verified consistent): funcSweepMu (exclusive) → interp.mutex(R)
→ funcMu (R then L) → frame.mutex (R).

Per-Eval CPU (O(n²) in accumulated entries): invert visitor-per-entry into
collect-once-then-intersect in preserveReturnedInterpretedFuncsLocked,
markInterpretedFuncMetadataEscapedLocked, rollbackInterpretedFuncPanicEscape,
and sweepRootInterpretedFuncs' seed scan (exact-set + anyAmbiguous flag;
ambiguous ⇒ all candidates live, faithful to funcValueVisitor's
ptr/slice/map ambiguity rules). No walk caps (truncation is either unsound or
re-creates the leak). Land the inversion with the purge.

No automatic eviction: its victims are by construction the host's live
callbacks — strictly worse than manual purge.

Test plan: purge frees after the host drops callbacks (count returns to
baseline; second purge returns 0); a still-retained purged callback stays
callable, misses lookupInterpretedFunc, and exhibits the documented stale-root
behavior after a cancel/detach; globals-reachable callbacks (incl. declared
funcs) are kept and still re-bind; groups pinned by undelivered channel sends
or panic tokens are skipped until retired; -race loop of purge × Eval ×
Globals × Symbols × channel sends; directFuncs source-key cleanup.

## Inventory — complete growth audit (branch vs master)

Everything else audited is bounded, transient, or pre-existing:
panic tokens (finished on every terminal path), callArgs (cleared per call),
group.bound (capped 1024 + reset), scopes/srcPkg/publishedSrcPkg/
globalVarIndexes (replaced wholesale), deferred (frame lifetime), zombie/go
goroutines (frame retention, no registry). REPL accumulation in interp.roots
(+1/Eval, AST pinned forever) is pre-existing and identical on master.
PR-introduced overheads: ~10-12% retained bytes per REPL Eval (larger per-root
AST/exec metadata), and the func-leading slot regression below.

## Func-leading REPL Eval slot growth — finding + dead ends (OPEN)

Finding (probe-verified): an incremental Eval beginning with `func` (bare
literal or IIFE) permanently adds +1..+3 global-frame slots on this branch
(60k slots / 173 MB after 20k Evals); master adds 0. Cause: master's parse
retry returned the synthetic-main FuncDecl (function scope, no global slots)
but replayed it on every later Eval; the PR's anti-replay fix returns the
wrapper BODY (ast.go ~619), compiling the statements in the global scope where
`case funcLit: n.findex = sc.add(n.typ)` (cfg.go ~574) permanently extends the
global frame.

Dead ends (attempted and reverted): (a) wrapping the body in a one-shot void
FuncLit call — the outer funcLit itself still allocates a global slot
(cfg.go:574 allocates the literal's value slot in the ENCLOSING scope before
pushing the function scope), net +3/Eval unchanged; void-result IIFEs broke
(`return voidCall()` rejected); (b) forwarding the inner result via a
synthesized outer function of the inner's type — same slot count, same void
breakage. Sound fixes require one of: codegen for immediately-called funcLits
without a registry slot; transient/recycled slot storage for root-level
literal entrypoints (must be goroutine-safe under `go`); or the scheduler-
level one-shot FuncDecl design the PR explicitly rejected. Left as a
documented open item: severity is REPL-shaped (thousands of func-Evals on one
interpreter), master-compatible behavior otherwise preserved.
